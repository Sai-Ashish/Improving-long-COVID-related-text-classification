2	Several immunotherapeutic strategies that take advantage of the exquisite specificity of the immune system to eliminate tumours have emerged over the last decade, among which cancer vaccines, blocking of immune control points and adoptional cell therapy act with the potential to revolutionize the standard of care for a range of tumours up to a large extent the specificity of immunotherapy is dependent on the recognition of specific antigens, especially neo-antigens, are a kind of antigen.

1	113 paired NSCLCs and adjacent non-tumour lung tissues were obtained in patients who underwent surgery in Jiangsu province hospital between 2008 and 2010 and were diagnosed with NSCLC (steps I II and III) based on histopathological evaluation. Clinical pathological characteristics, including tumour-node-metastasis (TNM), were recorded, and no local or systemic treatment was performed in these patients prior to surgery.

2	Studies on the immunological effects of probiotics on the host immune system have been conducted since the first observation of probiotic bacteria by Elie metchnikoff, according to whom and Fao probiotics are defined as living microanisms which, when administered in appropriate quantities, confer a health benefit to the host. Among several types of bacteria and yeasts that have identified and defined as probiotics the health benefits of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on the host have been proven
0	The purpose of this study was to determine serum levels of actinin4 ACTN4 in cervical cancer and to study the diagnostic and prognostic value of ACTN4 serum in CC Materials and Methods We included patients with intraepithelial CC neoplasia in the cervix and healthy women ACTN4 serum levels were evaluated using an ELISAmethod curve A receptor-specific ROC curve was performed to assess the diagnostic value of ACTN4 serum.

1	In the current study, a semi-markov model and the biparametric distribution of Weibull and Log-logic were used to measure the transition probabilities over time and to calculate the direct medical costs of LYG and QALY obtained from the practice presented in the trial [15]. A cost-effectiveness evaluation was conducted to analyze the economic impact of maintenance gefitinib treatment in locally advanced/metastatic NSCL patients with unknown EGFR mutations.
1	"These data indicate that the increase in BANCR induced by HDAC3 knockdown may be due to inhibition of HDAC3 enzyme activity. BANCR inhibits the viability of NSCLC cells and induces apoptosis In assessing the biological role of BANCR in NSCLC, we investigated the effects of the overexpression of BANCR on the viability and apoptosis of SPCA1 or A549 cells.
