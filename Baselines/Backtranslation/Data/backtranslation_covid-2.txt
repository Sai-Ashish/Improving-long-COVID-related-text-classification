1	Background The long-term VOCID syndrome refers to the long-term sequelae of the new viral disease, which occur even in patients with a history of mild disease. However, there is still little evidence of actual organic consequences and their frequency, and there is not yet a standardized method for diagnosing VOCID syndrome in the long term. In this study, we are working to determine the effectiveness of a progressive diagnostic approach for the recovery of VOCID to 19 patients with cardiopulmonary symptoms.
1	The feasibility of vitamin C in the treatment of postviral fatigue by focusing on the long VOCID Based on a systematic examination of vitamin C IV on fatigue is common not only in cancer patients, but also after viral infections and other infections. Effective treatment options are still very rare. Therefore, current knowledge on fatigue physiopathology and the potential positive impact of vitamin C treatment is illustrated. Furthermore, the efficacy of high-dose vitamin C IV in fatigue resulting from various diseases has been assessed.

However, the emotional reactions and behaviour of fathers are just as important. Usually, the father is the first to meet the premature newborn to know the condition of babies and to communicate with the mother and other family members. In this context, he is often left alone and may have psychological difficulties, including emotional disorders such as depression or anxiety.

1	A population-based cohort study Long-term consequences after SARS CoV 2 infection become a significant burden for societies and health systems Data on VOCID 19 syndrome in the general population are needed for timely planning of health services and resources. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of health conditions and physical and mental health symptoms in individuals at least six months after SARS CoV 2 infection and to characterize their use of health care.
